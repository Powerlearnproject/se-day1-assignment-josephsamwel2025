#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Q1:Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-software engineeering can be defined as the application of engineering principles to software development to ensure reliability,efficiency and maintainability and also to solving of the real world problems through technology.
-The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is that software engineering enables scalable, secure, and high-quality software solutions in industries like healthcare,finance, and automation hence helping to solve real world problems.

Q2:Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The three key milestones of software engineering are;
-1; The birth of software engineering(1968-1969-NATO Conference)
the term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO software engineering conference, and this was in response to the software crisis whereby the software projects were increasingly failing due to poor planning, inefficiency and high costs.
-2; The Introduction of the Waterfall Model(1970) 
Waterfall model was introduced by Winston Royce which was the first structured approach to software development and it laid the foundation for formal software development processes used in large scale systems.
-3; The rise of Agile methodologies(2001-Agile Manifesto)
It was was introduced by a group of software developers as an alternative to the rigid waterfall approach, it emphasized flexibility, collaboration,iterative development, and customer feedback.

Q3:List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-The phases of software development cycle are as follow;
-1;requirement analysis= this is gathering and analyzing user needs to define project scope and objectives
-2;planning= this involves defining project scope, timelines, resources, and also budgjet
-3;design= creating architectural and technical designs based on the requirements
-4;implementations(coding)= this involves writting the actual source code based on the design specifications
-5;Testing= this involves identifying and fixing bugs before deployment and it also includes unit testing,intergration testing,system testing and acceptance testing
-6;Deployment= this is the releasing of the software to end-users or clients
-7;Maintainance and support= involves fixing bugs, optimizing perfomance and adding of new features based on the users feedback.

Q4:Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall VS Agile methodologies
_waterfall is sequential and structured *While* Agile methodologies are iterative and flexible
_waterfall model follows predefined phases like requirements-design-implementation-testing-deployment-maintainance *while* Agile methodologies develops in short cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback
_waterfall model is Rigid, changes are difficult to implement once the process starts *while* Agile methodologies are highly adaptable to changes, even late in development
_waterfall model is best for well-defined, stable projects *while* Agile methodologies are best for evolving, dynamic projects
=The scenarios where Waterfall model would be appropiate is on projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal expected changes. for example;Military or Aerospace Software – Requires extensive documentation and strict compliance. also, Banking Systems – Needs high reliability and security with minimal changes.
=The scenarios where Agile methodologies would be appropiate is on projects that require flexibility and frequent updates. for example;mobile App Development – Features and user needs evolve rapidly. also, E-commerce Websites – Requires frequent updates based on customer behavior and trends.

Q5:Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-The role of a software developer in a software engineering team is to write, to test, and to maintain the software code.
-The role of a quality assurance engineer is to ensure software meets quality standards before release.
-The role of a project manager is to oversee the software development process, ensuring timely delivery.
/Responsibilities are as follows;
-The responsibilities of a software developer are,to develop applications based on project requirements,to Write clean, efficient, and scalable code, to collaborate with designers, testers, and other developers,to fix bugs and optimizes performance, to use version control tools like Git.
-The responsibilities of a quality assurance engineer are,to design and execute test cases (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing),to identify and report bugs to developers,to automate testing processes using tools like Selenium or JUnit,to ensure the software meets functional and performance requirements, to work closely with developers to resolve issues.
-The responsibilities of a project manager are, to define project scope, timeline, and budget, to coordinate between developers, testers, and stakeholders, to manage risks and resolves conflicts, to use project management tools like Jira or Trello, to ensure the project aligns with business goals.

Q6:Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Intergrated Development Environment(IDE's) is important as it provides a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, and testing, which improves productivity and efficiency in software development.
=the examples of Intergrated Development Environment are;_Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Lightweight, supports multiple languages, and has an extensive plugin ecosystem._JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA: Preferred for Java development, offers intelligent code completion._Eclipse: Popular for Java and other programming languages, widely used in enterprise applications.
-Version Control Systems(VCS) is important as it enables multiple developers to collaborate effectively while maintaining a history of modifications as the tracks changes to code.
=the examples of Version Control System are;_Git: The most widely used distributed VCS, often paired with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket._Apache Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS used in legacy enterprise applications._Mercurial: Another distributed VCS, known for its efficiency in handling large repositories.

Q7:What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-some common challenges faced by software engineers are as follows;
/Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes
/Debugging and Fixing Bugs Efficiently
/Managing Project Deadlines and Workload
/Security Vulnerabilities in Code
/Understanding Complex Codebases
-therefore software engineers are advised to use the following strategies;
/Participate in open-source projects and coding challenges.
/Use debugging tools and IDE features like breakpoints and stack traces.
/Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix or Agile methodologies.
/Follow secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, encryption).
/Use visualization tools like UML diagrams to understand architecture.

Q8:Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Software testing ensures that applications function correctly, efficiently, and securely before deployment and the types of testing are;
/Unit testing= Tests individual components (functions, methods, or classes) in isolation to verify that each part works correctly. and it's importance is that it detects bugs early in development, it ensures small, independent pieces of code function as expected, also it reduces debugging time later in the development cycle.
/Intergration testing=Tests how different modules or components of a system work together. it's importance is that it ensures seamless data flow between integrated components, it detects issues in the interactions between modules, it aslo prevents failures when combining independently developed components.
/System testing=This test evaluates the complete software system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements. it's importance is that it ensures the entire application works as intended, it tests for performance, security, and usability, it validates compliance with business requirements.
/Acceptance testing= This test determines whether the software meets the business needs and is ready for deployment. it's importance is ensuring the software aligns with user expectations, it validates real-world usability before release, it involves stakeholders to approve the final product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Q1:Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts(commands) to effectively communicate with AI models (such as ChatGPT,Gemini) to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses,it also involves structuring queries in a way that optimizes the AI’s understanding and output.
-The importance of prompt engineering in interaction with AI models is as follows;
/it enhances AI Accuracy & Relevance
/it improves Efficiency & Reduces Errors
/Optimizes AI for Specific Tasks
/it boosts Creativity & Innovation
/it improves AI Usability Across Domains
Therefore, Prompt engineering is a crucial skill for optimizing AI model interactions, ensuring more accurate, efficient, and domain-specific results.

Q2:Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Example of a Vague Prompt:"Tell me about history."
-Improved Prompt:"Provide a summary of the major events of World War II, including key battles, political leaders, and the war’s impact on global politics."
-The improved prompt is more effective because of the following reasons;
/The improved prompt is more Specific, for example,instead of a broad topic like "history," it focuses on World War II.
/The improved prompt has a clearly defined scope, for example it asks for major events, key battles, political leaders, and global impact, ensuring a well-structured response.
/The improved prompt is concise yet detailed, for example it keeps the question short while providing enough detail to guide the AI.
/The improved prompt reduces ambiguity,  The vague prompt could lead to information on any historical period, but the refined prompt ensures relevance.
